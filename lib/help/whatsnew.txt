Hellband
Based on Cthangband 3.1.2
Which in turn was based on Zangband 2.1.0

Changes are added to the top of this file, so for a chronological order read 
from the bottom up.

Hellband 1.0.3
* New 'makefile.org' included, thanks to Maija Toivola.
* New help files written for DOS and IBM versions.
* Cleaned up files for easier compilation under other operating systems 
(particularly Linux).
* Cleaned up character history tables.
* Ability scores no longer use the 'percentile' system.
* The screen is now refreshed after the options page is viewed - so the effects 
of any changed options are immediately visible.
* Fixed date problem with Halloween 'special event'.
* Introduced non-artefact permanent light sources (Orbs). There are normal orbs 
(which just produce light) and 33 types of 'ego' orbs.
* Changed 'main-dos.c' and 'makefile.dos' so that it will now compile with the 
latest version of Allegro.
* Fixed bugs in 'auto_pickup' option by undoing the change made in 1.0.1 which 
didn't work properly.

Hellband 1.0.2
* This variant has been renamed from 'Dangband' ('Dante-Band') to 'Hellband' to 
avoid conflicting with an existing Angband variant. The 'Hellband' name is, of 
course, a pun on the word 'hell-bound'.
* The 'Mutate body' corporeal spell has been renamed to 'Corrupt body'.
* The random name generator has been expanded to now provide 'angelic' names for 
Devilspawn, Nephilim and Imps and to provide 'yeekish' names for Yeeks.
* Racial Power descriptions have been made more readable in the 'use power' 
choice menu.

Hellband 1.0.1
* Removed out-of-genre 'radiation' and replaced it with 'hellslime'.
* Changed the flavour text of many corruptions, making them more in-genre.
* 'Cheat' options have been removed, to remove temptation.
* Swapped the order of effects in the 'Major Displacement' mindcrafter power.
* Corporeal realm now gets 'Wraithform' instead of 'Polymorph Self'.
* Windows version defaults to using graphics if no '.ini' file is found.
* Changed the 'g' and ',' commands so that they are consistent - regardless of 
the current 'auto_pickup' value.
* The alchemist shop can now research an item, which identifies it fully.
* The 'Identify All' shop function has been moved to the pawnbrokers.
* Spectres now glow in the dark.
* Imps now get fire immunity at level 20.
* All Half-Trolls now get slow digestion, not just warriors.
* Charisma is now abbreviated to 'CHA' rather than 'CHR'.
* The time taken to use Mindcrafting powers now scales like that for spells.
* The time taken to cast spells now scales properly.

of the RFX_XXXX flags by monster level.
* Win-screen is now a text file (WINNER.TXT) like the DEAD.TXT and NEWS.TXT 
files.
* Some clean-up of folder structure implemented - 'pref' files are now located 
in the 'pref' folder (not the 'user' folder) and spoilers now have the suffix 
'.txt' and are output to the 'info' folder.
* Monster recall (and spoiler) now gives attack speed if at least one attack is 
known.
* Added a 'Destroy All' command ('K') to destroy all worthless items in your 
pack and equipment list (equipped cursed items are not destroyed by this).

died).

* Monster breaths are now cone shaped, rather than ball shaped (from Zangband)

systems.
* Windows version asks for a profile name when starting a new file, rather than 
automatically naming it after the character that is generated.

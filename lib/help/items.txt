Items
=====

There are many types of item in Hellband. They range from powerful artefacts to 
useless shards of pottery. Many items will be found lying around, and more will 
be dropped by creatures when they die.

The shops in town will buy and sell items of most types.

Weapons
=======

Weapons are described as follows:

a war hammer of extra attacks (3d3) (+1, +7) (+3 to attack speed)

  ^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^  ^^  ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      1               2         3     4   5          6

1 = The type of weapon.
2 = The special ability of the weapon.
3 = The basic damage done by the weapon, in dice.
4 = The bonus to hit of the weapon.
5 = The bonus to damage of the weapon.
6 = The details (if needed) of the special ability.

Armour
======

Armour is described as follows:

Hard studded leather of Heaven (-1) [7, +10] (+2 to stealth)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^ ^^^^  ^  ^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
         1                 2     3   4   5          6

1 = The type of armour.
2 = The special ability of the armour.
3 = The penalty to attacks caused by the bulk of the armour.
4 = The base armour class provided by the armour.
5 = The bonus to armour class provided by the armour.
6 = The details (if needed) of the special ability.

Armour is split into six categories, depending on which part of the body it 
covers - head, body, hands, feet, cloak and shield. Armour in different 
categories can be worn simultaneously and all bonuses stack.

Note that only body armour will cause an attack penalty (3 above).

Wands
=====

Wands are small magical devices that contain spells. Wands typically contain 
combat spells, or at least spells that need to be aimed at a target. A wand will 
typically contain a number of charges. Empty wands are not worthless, since they 
can still be recharged.

Staffs
======
Staffs similar to wands, except that they usually contain more general magics 
rather than aimed magics. Staffs also have charges, and like wands they can be 
recharged.

Rods
====

Rods are somewhat similar to wands and staffs, except that they do not have 
charges. A rod can be used indefinitely, although there will need to be a 
recharge period before each use.

Rings & Amulets
===============

Rings and amulets are both similar in that they contain constant magic that 
affects the wielder for as long as the item is worn. There is no need to 
activate a ring or amulet. Simply wearing one is sufficient to achieve its 
benefits.

Potions
=======

Potions contain single use spells. Quaffing the potion causes the spell to 
affect you.

Scrolls
=======

Scrolls are similar to potions except that they are somewhat more difficult to 
use - you need to be able to read the magics from them. Scrolls also tend to 
have magics that affect an area, rather than the more personal magic contained 
in potions.

Food
====

Food comes in a variety of types, from the barely edible slime moulds that grow 
around the dungeon to high quality foods such as elven waybread.

Some foods - most notably mushrooms - may have other effects rather than simply 
satiating your hunger.

Lights
======

The most common light sources are torches. It is also possible to find or buy 
lanterns, which give out more light than a torch. Lanterns need a steady supply 
of oil to keep running.

It is also possible to buy or find magical orbs that give out as much light as a 
lantern but may also have a variety of other effects. The effects of orbs are 
constant whilst the orb is active as a light source (i.e. being wielded). There 
is no special command to activate an orb.

Artefacts
=========

As well as finding normal items, both magical and mundane, it is possible to 
occasionally find artefacts.

Artefacts are unique items, which often have special abilities far beyond their 
more mundane cousins. Artefacts are not a type of item per se-. Instead, they 
are a subcategory of the other types of item (such as weapons, armour, rings, 
etc.)

Many artefacts can be activated for magical effects, even if the base type of 
item is not activatable (such as a ring).

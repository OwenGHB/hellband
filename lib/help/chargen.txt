Greating a Character
====================

Before you can descend into Hell, you must generate ar character. This help file
explains the creation of your character.

Making a choice
===============

You can look at the different choices by pressing either the up/down keys or the
'8'/'2' keys, you can confirm by pressing space or enter. The selected choice is
always preceded with the '>' character and in a different color.

Gender
======

The first choice is your character's gender. Most roguelikes treat gender like a
roleplaying choice. In Hellband you will find male characters to be easy targets
for succubi and lilu. You will also find that some races like the Leprechaun are
only available to a single gender. There is no 'better' gender in Hellband.

Genus
=====

The second choice is your character's genus or race. The four main races you can
choose from are Human, Fae, Spawn and Elder. Each race has subspecies with diff-
erent powers. Only the human race can choose a birth sign, except for the cursed
ones like vampires and werewolves. Fae, Spawns and the Elder races are generally
chosen by more advanced players.

Subspecies
==========

The third choice is your character's subspecies, this will impact your strength,
dexterity, constitution, wisdom, intelligence and charisma. ( Your stats )

It will also influence your 'Hit Dice'. High Hit Dice mean beefy characters, low
Hit Dice mean wimpy characters.

It will also influence your 'Experience Factor'. A lower Experience Factor means
less effort to gain levels.

Finally some subspecies have special powers that are described on the right hand
side of the screen.

Birthsign
=========

Only humans can be affected by their birth sign. Afflicted humans like vampires,
werewolves or zombies are no longer under the influence of their birthsign.

Birthsigns, like subspecies, can influence initial stats, hit dice, extra powers
and sometimes impacts experience gain. Special powers are described on the left-
hands side of the screen.

Choosing to be 'Free' means that your faith is not determined by the stars, it's
said that the Elder Gods are very concerned with those that are born Free.

Vocation
========

The next choice is the character's vocation or class. Like subspecies, vocations
influence initial stats, hit dice and experience factor. A vocation's powers and
drawbacks are described on the right hand side of the screen.

Realm(s)
========

Spellcasters need to choose one or two magic realms. Some vocations allow you to
choose any realm but others restrict your choice. In some cases, the choice will
be automatic and this stage of character creation will be skipped. You will find
descriptions of each realm on the right hand side of the screen.

Stats
=====

Your character has six primary stats: 
          Strength     (STR)
          Intelligence (INT)
          Wisdom       (WIS)
          Dexterity    (DEX)
          Constitution (CON)
          Charisma     (CHA)
	  
Each of these is normally measured on a 3-18 scale for a normal human. 
Exceptional humans (such as those with special bloodstrains) may have stat 
scores higher than 18. Stats higher than 29 are not possible without magical
enhancements.

Stats that are above average give you bonuses on certain actions. Stats 
below average give you penalties on the same actions.

*Strength*
Your strength score indicates how much raw strength your character has. Strength
bonuses apply to bashing down doors, the distance that items can be thrown, the
size of weapon that can be wielded, the amount of equipment that can be carried
without encumbering you, how easily your melee attacks hit, how much damage your
melee attacks do and how quickly you can dig.

*Intelligence*
Your intelligence score shows how smart your character is. It is a reflection of
their thinking power, not knowledge and common sense. Intelligence bonuses apply
to number of spell points (for some classes), number of spells known (for some
classes), failure chance of spells (for some classes), disarming traps and using
magical devices.

*Wisdom*
Your wisdom shows your knowledge and common sense. Wisdom bonuses apply to 
number of spell points (for some classes), number of spells known (for some
classes), failure chance of spells (for some classes) and resisting enemy magic,

*Dexterity*
Your dexterity is a measure of your speed and agility. Dexterity bonuses apply
to avoiding theft, avoiding damage when falling, avoiding being hit, how easily
your attacks hit and disarming traps

*Constitution*
Your constitution is a measure of how generally hardy you are. Constitution
bonuses apply to recovering from poison, recovering from bleeding, recovering
from stunning and number of hit points.

*Charisma*
Charisma is a measure of the impression your character makes on people. As such,
it reflects poise, looks and force of personality. Your charisma bonus affects
the prices that you are charged for various services in stores.

In addition, various corruptions or racial powers may be affected by the bonus 
of any of the six stats.

During character generation, starting stats are either bought with
points or rolled randomly (depending on which option you have selected).

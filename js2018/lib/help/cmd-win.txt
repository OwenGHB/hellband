Keyboard Commands
=================

Hellband can be controlled entirely from the keyboard. The mouse is not used, 
except to use the menus. Other than selecting whether to load a player profile 
or start a new one, all menu items simply duplicate keypresses.

Most commands consist of the pressing of a single key. Some need multiple 
keypresses - for example commands that ask for a direction or commands that ask 
for an object. If a command needs extra keypresses after the first, then you 
will be prompted at the top of the screen for whatever further input is needed.

Note that lower-case commands and upper-case commands are different from each 
other.

Basic Movement
==============

Hellband uses the number keys to move. They are as follows (on the numberpad, 
regardless of the status of NumLock)

7 8 9
 \|/
4-5-6
 /|\
1 2 3

These keys are used to move one square in each of the eight directions. The '5' 
key is used to stand still for a turn. When moving using these keys, items may 
or may not be picked up - depending on which options have been set.

Other Movement Commands
=======================

';' <direction>         Take a single step in a direction, picking up objects 
                        if your options are set to do so.

'-' <direction>         Take a single step in a direction, picking up objects 
                        if your options are set not to do so.
                  
'.' <direction>         Run in the specified direction.

','                     Stand still, picking up objects according to settings.

'g'                     Stand still, picking up objects according to settings.

'o' <direction>         Open a door or chest.

'c' < direction>        Close a door.

'D' <direction>         Disarm a trap.

'T' <direction>         Tunnel through the rock.

'+' <direction>         Either open, close, disarm or tunnel, depending on 
                        which action the computer thinks is most appropriate for
                        the square that you have indicated.

'R' <duration>          Rest either for a number of turns or until healed or 
                        until something 'interesting' happens. What is 
                        considered to be 'interesting' depends on your settings.

's'                     Search the squares around you for traps and/or secret 
                        doors. Note that this is not guaranteed to work, and you
                        may need to search repeatedly to find something.
                  
'S'                     Switch 'search mode' on/off. During search mode, you 
                        automatically perform a search each time you enter a new
                        square. Search mode turns itself off automatically if you
                        are interrupted.

'<'                     Go up a staircase.

'>'                     Go down a staircase.

'j'                     Jam a door closed with a spike.

'B'                     Bash a door to try to force it open.

General Object Commands
=======================

't'                     Take off an object.

Object Specific Commands
========================

(Note that if the 'unify_commands' option is set, all the object specific 
commands can be used interchangeably - the computer will decide what is the most 
suitable action to perform with an object.)

System Commands
===============

These commands are for interacting with the program of Hellband, and have no in-
game effect. None of these commands take any game-time, so they can be used at 
will with no danger.

'M'                     View a map of the whole level that your character is on

'L'                     Locate your character on the map.

'*'                     Pre-emptively specify a target for future spells and 
                        missile attacks.

'?'                     View the help files.

                        file.

'%'                     Change which character/colour combinations (or which 
                        graphics) represent each object or creature within the 
                        game.

'&'                     Adjust the RGB values of the various colours used 
                        within Hellband.

<Ctrl>'f'               Repeat the level feeling and quest information for the 
                        current level.

                        overwritten when Hellband is exited normally. This is 
                        only used to keep the save-file updated in case your 
                        computer crashes.

<Ctrl>'x'               Exit Hellband. This has exactly the same effect as 
                        closing the Hellband window.

'Q'                     Quit the current game, killing (by suicide) your 
                        character.

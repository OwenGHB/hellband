What is Hellband ?
==================

Welcome to Hellband. This is a turn-based game of strategy, skill and some luck.
Hellband has its roots in the game 'Rogue' (an old computer game from around the
time of Pong and Space Invaders) and falls into the genre of 'Rogue-like' games.

More specifically, Hellband is the offspring of the popular roguelike 'Angband'.

Hellband is similar to recent computer RPG's like Diablo 3 or Final Fantasy, and
so on. You control a customized character who gets geared up and explores a vast
underground 'dungeon', searching for treasure and glory.

Fighting creatures gains you experience - which improves your abilities. Finding
better treasure and magical items also improves your abilities and your fighting
capability. What sets apart Hellband from the other games is that whereas modern
computer RPGs are 'real-time', Hellband is turn based. There is no need to click
frantically around the screen  to kill something. Instead, you can take time and
think about what you are doing and about what tactics to use.

The other big difference between Hellband and most modern computer games are the
graphics and sound. Most games nowadays have about two dozen monsters, where all
off them are rendered in 3D-accelerated polygons and textures. Hellband does not
have a fancy graphics system. Each type of monster is represented by a color and
a letter. This allows for a ton more monsters and variety than would be feasible
for a commercial software company to put in a game. You will encounter more than
600 different monsters spread over 120 levels of play, a variety that commercial
games simply cannot afford to produce professional graphics for.

On save files and Dying
=======================

Hellband is different from most computer games in how it treats saving progress.

Whereas other games allow you to save as often as you would like, so that if you
come across a tough part you can load repeatedly and try again, Hellband is more
realistic.

In this game you can't reload after when death occurs. You only have one life in
this game, so if you do something dangerous and you die,you will have to restart
with a new character.

That does not mean that you need to create a new 'save game'. Next time you load
Hellband , you can use your saved profile as normal. You will keep the values of
any options that you set in your previous game, and it will keep the memories of
your previous character, like monster weaknesses.

With this Windows version, you can have different player-profiles in your 'save'
folder , each with its own options and its own history of characters. Also, this
allows for 'save scumming'. Save scumming is the practice to save before a scary
event and make a copy of the file in Windows Explorer. This is generally frowned
upon by the community, but my motto is that 'More fun is better'.

Basic Gameplay
==============

The game starts (after generating a new character) in the town of Volterra. Your
first task is to explore the shops and purchase equipment (keeping your distance
from the locals, as this odd marketplace attracts all sorts of unsavoury types).
Your character starts fully outfitted for combat, but you probably want to learn
your starter spell in the library if you are a spellcaster and visit the alchemy
shop for potions and scrolls. With that done, you can head for the red staircase
leading down into the sewers of Volterra.

Once you start descending deeper into Hell, the game changes. You need will need
to explore the dungeons around you, looking for treasure and killing sinners and
demons alike. There are lots of opportunities to descend fast into Hell, but you
should be very wary since descending too quickly will almost certainly result in
your death.

User Interface
==============

During gameplay, the screen is split into two sections.

The largest part is a top-down representation of you and your surroundings. This
is where most of the activity takes place. You will usually see an 'aura' around
yourself. This is your 'line of sight', and shows what you can see. Anything out
side this aura is outside your field of vision. If you carry a light source, you
will also see a usually smaller aura around yourself which shows the area lit by
your light. Different light sources shed light at different ranges. If you don't
have the power of 'Infravision', then you can not look past the illuminated area
unless you are looking at an independently lit area.

At the top of the screen is an area reserved for text messages. As you play this
game, various message will be displayed there. Often, if the game needs an input
from you, you will type text there.

At the bottom of the screen you will find the most important attributes, such as
hit points, spell points, gold, monster health bar, dungeon level and indicators
of temporary conditions (Are you bleeding, stunned, shielded, blessed etc.). The
'monster health bar' tracks both health and status of monsters that attacked you
or that you targeted.

Time and Turns
==============

Time passes in the game world with almost every key press you make to perform an
action.

One day in the game is split into 10000 turns of just under 10 seconds each. The
game times things in hundredths of a turns, so it is possible for actions to not
take an exact number of turns to perform.

Assuming you are moving at at regular speed, a single movement will take 1 turn.
Having your speed magically increased or decreased (or decreased by carrying too 
much weight) will alter this, causing each move to take more than or less than a 
turn.

Attacking a creature will take anywhere from 10% of a turn to a full turn, based
on the number of attacks that you have.

Casting spells will similarly take from 10% of a turn to a full turn, determined
by how many far above the spell level your character's level is.

The other actions are rated based on this turn-scale, usually as a percentage of
a turn.

Combat Speed
============

There are no separate 'combat turns' in Hellband like in most D&D based computer
games, instead you are experiencing a feature called "fractional blows". Whereas
in other games you use all your attack blows on one monster, hellband allows you
to spread your attacks. This means that if you have 3 blows with your character,
and you are standing near an almost dead Heretic, you can slay that Heretic with
one blow and use your 2 other blows for other adjacent monsters. This way your 2
remaining blows don't get wasted.

It is the same way for monsters, if they have 4 attacks, you will never bear all
4 at once (unless you're really slow), but you will be trading blows. Just think
of it as being in the Matrix in slow motion.

Combat Stats
============

Each creature (yourself included) has three scores relative to combat.

Firstly, you have a number of 'Hit Points'. They represent a combination of both
endurance and physical toughness. Each time you are hit, you will lose an amount
of hit points. Should you ever get below 0 hit points you will die.

Secondly, you have an 'Armor Class'. This number starts at 0 and increases as it
gets better. It represents both your skil at dodging blows and how well armoured
you are. The higher the number, the more difficult you are to hit - and the more
the damage gets soaked by your armor.

Finally, you have an 'Attack Score'. The exact value is hidden from you and gets
used when you combat an opponent, it is compared to the AC (Armour Class) of the
opponent you are fighting. Your character sheet will display a guide to how good
your attack score is, but not the exact numerical value.
